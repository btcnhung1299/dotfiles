# Dotfiles
This repository contains my configuration for:
- vim
- zsh
- tmux

1. Modify `HOME` and `LOCAL_HOME` path and execture init script
```console
bash init.sh
```
2. Copy lines in `temp.sh` and add to the beginning of .zshrc to see global variable `HOME` and `LOCAL_HOME` in zsh interactive shell
3. Run `zsh` to custom shell and install plug-ins
