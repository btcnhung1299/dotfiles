# Dotfiles
This repository contains my configuration for:
- vim
- zsh
- tmux

1. Modify `HOME` and `LOCAL_HOME` path and execture init script
```console
bash init.sh
```
2. Re-login for changes to take effects
3. As oh-my-zsh installed, re-run `init.sh` to link `zsh.rc` to the local zsh configuration
